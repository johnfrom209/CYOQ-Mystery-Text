  storyText: 'Before you can gather your thoughts chaos begins to descend on the
    carriage. The horse wails out a high pitch neigh, suddenly stopping the ride.
    The boy begins to yell out in pain. You quickly pull the flap of cloth that seperated
    you three, and a fowl stench hits your nostrils. You retch in place, as tears
    begin to well up. You search for the father but he is no where to be seen. The
    boy struggles past you clutching his arm. Before you can gather yourself the
    carriage begins to rock back and forth. Eventually it topples over. As you struggle
    to your feet a horde of undead decends upon you.


    1. Game Over'
