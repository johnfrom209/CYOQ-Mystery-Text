  storyText: 'The husband speaks up first. "It was late at night." he pauses for
    a moment. "We were sound asleep when the noise woke us. I ran to the room...it
    was dark and I couldn''t see much. But I can tell you it wasn''t human. It escaped
    through the window, but before it was out I instinctly made my way to shut the
    window. When I slammed it shut it made a chittering noise, then hissed at me.
