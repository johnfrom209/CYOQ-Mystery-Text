  storyText: 'Now that you are on board we have to get down to business. I have three
    cases here with very little information, so were going straight to the source.
    First one up is Annie. She says her brothers been missing for a couple of weeks
    now. After that we gotta check out a kidnapping. If what I hear about it are
    true then there''s not much hope for the parents. Last place to check out is
    the bonfire. Not sure what''s going on there so were both in the dark.
