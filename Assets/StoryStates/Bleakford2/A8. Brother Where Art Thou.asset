  storyText: "Wow. Looks who's finally off their ass and doing their job. Seems like
    its been a week since I reported my brother missing. We, got tired of waiting
    for you to do something about the missing people, so a few of us are getting
    together to head out into the wetlands and look for some clues on the missing
    people. No need for you to get involved, we have it covered. \nShe glares as
    she waits for you to leave.\n\n1. I understand how you feel. Our hands were tied
    before, but we want to help now.\n2. She says she has it under control."
