  storyText: 'Okay, Annie, here''s the plan. We have a couple more people to visit
    tonight and once we get that done we can head out with you. I know you all are
    itching to get out there, but having us along reduces the risk of anything bad
    happening. Whatever is behind all this, I''m sure we can help take it down.

    She
    looks down for a second, sighs and says, "You have two hours before we leave.
    With or without you."


    1. See you in two hours. '
