    Hey deputy, I''ve been looking
    into these missing people and they all seem to go missing under the same effects.
    Its not something I''ve ever heard of before so it could be some kind of magic.
    I''ve sent a letter to up to command, but they have their hands full.

    Now,
    this next case is a bit delicate. Parents lost their baby. Talk to them to see
    if you can get any good information out of this, then meet me in the baby''s
    room.


    1. That is tough'
