  storyText: "Before you can sit down the man starts to berate you about...something.
    You try to listen but everything he says goes in one ear and out the other. You
    try a little harder but your head begins to throb in pain.\nThe man takes a breath.
    \"Your drinking has gotten out of hand. Either you nip it in the butt now or
    you have to turn in your badge.\" \nHe slids you a glass of water.\n\n1. You're
