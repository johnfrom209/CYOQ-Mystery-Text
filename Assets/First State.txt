Mystery of the Night before.

[Splash] ...you awaken when cold water hits your face. 
A gruff looking man stands over you with an unpleasant look on his face.
"Wake up we need to talk. I need to know what happened last night.
	We should talk in my office. Follow me upstairs."

Choice: Left goes upstairs  // Right goes into a dark hallway where you can hear some metal banging.
